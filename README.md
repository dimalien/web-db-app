# **web-db-app project** 

this is a golang learning project that I did after learning the basics of golang. it turned out something like a microservice. The web server starts here. its task is to accept and process http requests. There are two types of requests. A request to the main page and a request to the users' page, in this case, the request handler takes values from the database.
I do not know either the architecture of web applications or micro service architecture yet.
This project is written without using frameworks or orm
